## Notable Differences ##

- the Windows Title bar reveals the LDD Version to be named "LDD Hollywood Edition"
- the Menu Bar has an extra "Developer" entry - most likely enabled via developer mode
- there are 4 additional icons in the tool bar.
  - One additional selection arrow
  - One icon seems to be for moving bricks judging from the icon itself or maybe a view all function (the hover text is dificult to decipher in the videos
  - the next blueish icon seems just random lines painted (in 'The LEGO Movie') and later it looks like a snowflake icon
  - the icon at the most right is the same icon as the 'selection to group icon'. Maybe some kind of shortcut.
- at the far right there seems to be a send button
- the version shown doesn't have a stud ground indicator, but instead an origin xyz indicator (xyz indicator is also available in normal LDD with developer mode)
- all the bricks in the brick selection bar are colored in grey and not in red in Extended mode
- more hover text in bricks palette (also available in normal LDD with developer mod)
- a different colored Application Icon (light brown or maybe gold?) in difference to blue
