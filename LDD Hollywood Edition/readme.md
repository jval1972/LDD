## Notable Differences ##

- the Windows Title bar revels the LDD Version to be named "LDD Hollywood Edition"
- the Menu Bar has an extra "Developer" entry
- there are 3 additional icons in the tool bar.
  - One icon seems to be for moving bricks (judging from the icon itself)
  - the next blueish icon seems just random lines painted
  - the icon at the most right is the same icon as the 'selection to group icon'. Maybe some kind of shortcut.
- at the far right there seems to be a send button
- the version shown doesn't have a stud ground indicator, but instead an origin xyz indicator
- all the bricks in the brick selection bar are colored in grey and not in red in Extended mï»¿ode
