## Notable Differences ##

- the Windows Title bar reveals the LDD Version to be named "LDD Hollywood Edition"
- the Menu Bar has an extra "Developer" entry - most likely enabled via developer mode
- there are 4 additional icons in the tool bar.
  - One additional selection arrow
  - One icon seems to be for moving bricks judging from the icon itself or maybe a view all function (the hover text is dificult to decipher in the videos
  - the next blueish icon seems just random lines painted (in 'The LEGO Movie') and later it looks like a snowflake icon
  - the icon at the most right is the same icon as the 'selection to group icon'. Maybe some kind of shortcut.
- at the far right there seems to be a send button
- the version shown doesn't have a stud ground indicator, but instead an origin xyz indicator (xyz indicator is also available in normal LDD with developer mode)
- all the bricks in the brick selection bar are colored in grey and not in red in Extended mode
- more hover text in bricks palette (also available in normal LDD with developer mod)
- a different colored Application Icon (light brown or maybe gold?) in difference to blue

## LDD LEGOLAND Edition

Quote from Eurobricks thread: https://www.eurobricks.com/forum/index.php?/forums/topic/182091-ldd-analysis-thread/&page=2

LEGOLAND and Hollywood Edition builds are identical, the only difference being that with Hollywood you can export to Maya (as someone in this thread predicted).

- Tool 1 is the classic grab tool
- Tool 2 is grab everything connected to the brick you're selecting
- Tool 3 is move (but more precise)
- 10 is freeze which is used in the "view" mode
- 12 is group.

Wireframes show if you click on certain numbers, I think it goes up to 7? I forgot.

View mode is different, instead of having random skyboxes it's instead used to animate, it's very broken though.

Pallet bricks are grey automatically in extended mode.

Send to LEGO.com is still there, correct, but clicking it does nothing.

Brick count is a preference setting.

The logo for LDD LEGOLAND is a gold/yellow brick.

Models automatically save as lxfml instead of lxf.

If the programme crashes it autosaves where left off so you can continue without restarting.

That's all I can think of from the top of my head! I wish I still had LDD LEGOLAND because it's much faster than the original software.
