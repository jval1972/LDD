========
* UPGRADE: added AmbientOcclusion (as "type ambient") to my Mix and LinearGradient shaders
* UPDATE: added some previously missing brick seams
* UPDATE: added some previously missing LOS
* UPDATE: added several options for "mat1" (WHITE) colorization in bublible_materials.sc (just uncomment the one you want to use)
* FIX: rendering ended up in error if background (sky/horizon) would be visible in render
* FIX: Rubber material did not look as expected
